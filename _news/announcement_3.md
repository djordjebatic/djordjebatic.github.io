Pleased to announce that I've succesfully defended my PhD thesis! I would like to thank my supervisors, Vladimir and Lina Stankovic, for their support, as well as my external examiners, Nikos Deligiannis and Johannes Norheim for their valuable input, insightful discussion, and the time dedicated to my work
