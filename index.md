## Overview

The intensifying challenges of climate change combined with a surging energy demand 
underscore the crucial need to refine existing smart grid observability methodologies. Smart 
grid has revolutionized the interaction between renewable energy sources and consumers. 
At the same time, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure offers a wealth of data on energy 
usage, paving the way for detailed profiling of consumer demand, efficient load and 
renewable energy forecasting, as well as improved monitoring and data handling.
With the escalating complexity of the grid, there is a growing need for advanced 
computational methods to oversee grid ecosystems, considering both utility and end-user 
perspectives. This necessitates more observable, accessible, and controllable network 
infrastructures.

This special session offers an opportunity for researchers from various research fields, such 
as machine learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, power 
and energy systems, communications, optimization, and control engineering, to share their 
insights on how computational intelligence techniques can enhance observability and 
electrical signal processing for Smart Grids and Sustainable Energy Systems.
Electrical signal processing is a key component of such systems, as it enables the extraction 
of useful information, such as load profiles, power quality, energy consumption, and 
generation patterns. Computational intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural 
networks, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary algorithms, can improve the performance and 
accuracy of electrical signal processing methods, by providing adaptive, robust, and scalable 
solutions to the challenges posed by the smart grid.

The main aim of this special session is to bridge the gap between computational intelligence techniques 
and the pressing issues related to electrical power and energy systems. The session is 
supported by the IEEE CIS Task Force on Computational Intelligence in the Energy Domain (CI4Energy).
